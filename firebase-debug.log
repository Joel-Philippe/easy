The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses other Firebase or Google Cloud Platform services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nWhen you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# firestore-send-email\n\n**VERSION**: 0.1.0\n\n**DESCRIPTION**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:**\n\n* Deployment location: Where should the extension be deployed?

Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** An array containing the recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** An array containing the CC recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** An array containing the BCC recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# firestore-send-email\n\n**VERSION**: 0.1.0\n\n**DESCRIPTION**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:**\n\n* Deployment location: *Where should the extension be deployed?

Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# firestore-send-email\n\n**VERSION**: 0.1.0\n\n**DESCRIPTION**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:**\n\n* Deployment location: Where should the extension be deployed?

The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# firestore-send-email\n\n**VERSION**: 0.1.0\n\n**DESCRIPTION**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:**\n\n* Deployment location: Where should the extension be deployed?

Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

[Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n- **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n- **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n- **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n- **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n- **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n- **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array of attachments with template strings as values; [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pre-generated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\",\n  attachments: [\n    {\n     filename: \"{{username}}.jpg\",\n     path: \"{{imagePath}}\" \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n        imagePath: \"https://path-to-file/image-name.jpg\"\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s free tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array of attachments with template strings as values; [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pre-generated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\",\n  attachments: [\n    {\n     filename: \"{{username}}.jpg\",\n     path: \"{{imagePath}}\" \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n        imagePath: \"https://path-to-file/image-name.jpg\"\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s free tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n- **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n- **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n- **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n- **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n- **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n- **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array of attachments with template strings as values; [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pre-generated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\",\n  attachments: [\n    {\n     filename: \"{{username}}.jpg\",\n     path: \"{{imagePath}}\" \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n        imagePath: \"https://path-to-file/image-name.jpg\"\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s free tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n* **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.

At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.

At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

(username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords.

(username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

[See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n* **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and password)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy?

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy?

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setup Google App Passwords\n\n**Google** no longer allows **Gmail** users to use their own passwords to authorize third-party apps and services. Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.  Your account is through work, school, or other organization.\n    4.  You turned on Advanced Protection.\n4.  At the bottom, choose **Select app** and choose **Other** option and then write the name of the app password (e.g. `Firebase Trigger Email from Firestore Extension`) and click **Generate**.\n5.  Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.\n6.  Tap **Done**.\n\nNow you can use your Google username with the generated password to authorize the extension.\n\n#### Setup Hotmail Passwords\n\nTo use your Outlook/Hotmail email account with this extension, you'll need to have 2FA enabled on your account, and [Create an App Password](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-and-two-step-verification).\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.

Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates.

Instead, you have to use the [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) service to generate a special password for each app you want to authorize. To do so:\n\n1.  Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/).\n2.  Select **Security**.\n3.  Under \"Signing in to Google,\" select **App Passwords**. You may need to sign in. If you don’t have this option, it might be because:\n    1.  2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.\n    2.  2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.\n    3.

(username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.

(username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

[Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n* **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away:\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n* **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/database/firestore/data).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n    html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n  }\n}).then(() => console.log('Queued email for delivery!'));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n* **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n* **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n* **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n* **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n* **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n* **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n* **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n* **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n* **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n* **subject:** The subject of the email.\n* **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n* **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the *template name* in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n* **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n* **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n* **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n* **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}').add({\n  toUids: ['abc123'],\n  template: {\n    name: 'following',\n    data: {\n      username: 'ada',\n      name: 'Ada Lovelace'\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n* **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n* **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n* **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n* **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n* **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n* **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n* **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  * **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  * **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  * **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  * **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  * **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\n\nThis extension uses other Firebase or Google Cloud Platform services which may have associated charges:\n\n- Cloud Firestore\n- Cloud Functions\n\nWhen you use Firebase Extensions, you're only charged for the underlying resources that you use. A paid-tier billing plan is only required if the extension uses a service that requires a paid-tier plan, for example calling to a Google Cloud Platform API or making outbound network requests to non-Google services. All Firebase services offer a free tier of usage. [Learn more about Firebase billing.](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server that this extension can use to deliver email.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

[See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n- **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n- **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n- **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n- **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n- **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n- **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s free tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n- **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n- **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n- **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n- **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n- **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n- **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nAfter its installation, this extension monitors all document writes to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection. Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n- **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n- **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n- **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n- **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n- **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n- **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\"\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s free tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console.\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.

Email is delivered based on the contents of the document's fields. The top-level fields specify the email's sender and recipients. The `message` field contains the details of the email to deliver, including the email body.\n\n#### Sender and recipient fields\n\nThe top-level fields of the document supply the email sender and recipient information. Available fields are:\n\n- **from:** The sender's email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default FROM address\" parameter.\n- **replyTo:** The reply-to email address. If not specified in the document, uses the configured \"Default REPLY-TO address\" parameter.\n- **to:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **toUids:** An array containing the recipient UIDs.\n- **cc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **ccUids:** An array containing the CC recipient UIDs.\n- **bcc:** A single recipient email address or an array containing multiple recipient email addresses.\n- **bccUids:** An array containing the BCC recipient UIDs.\n- **headers:** An object of additional header fields (for example, `{\"X-Custom-Header\": \"value\", \"X-Second-Custom-Header\": \"value\"}`).\n\n**NOTE:** The `toUids`, `ccUids`, and `bccUids` options deliver emails based on user UIDs keyed to email addresses within a Cloud Firestore document. To use these recipient options, you need to specify a Cloud Firestore collection for the extension's \"Users collection\" parameter. The extension can then read the `email` field for each UID specified in the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` fields.\n\n#### Message field\n\nThe `message` field of the document contains raw delivery information for the email. This field should generally only be populated by trusted code running in your own servers or Cloud Functions (refer to the \"Security rules and sending email\" section below).\n\nAvailable properties for the `message` field are:\n\n- **messageId:** A message ID header for the email, if any.\n- **subject:** The subject of the email.\n- **text:** The plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** The HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** The [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array containing attachment(s); [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pregenerated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\n#### Using templates\n\nIf you specified a \"Templates collection\" parameter during configuration of the extension, you can create and manage [Handlebars][handlebars] templates for your emails. Each document for a template should have a memorable ID that you use as the _template name_ in the document that's written to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection.\n\nThe template document can include any of the following fields:\n\n- **subject:** A template string for the subject of the email.\n- **text:** A template string for the plaintext content of the email.\n- **html:** A template string for the HTML content of the email.\n- **amp:** A template string for the [AMP4EMAIL][amp4email] content of the email.\n- **attachments:** An array of attachments with template strings as values; [Nodemailer options](https://nodemailer.com/message/attachments/) supported: utf-8 string, custom content type, URL, encoded string, data URI, and pre-generated MIME node (be aware that your email has no access to the cloud server's file system).\n\nAn example template might have an ID of `following` and content like:\n\n```js\n{\n  subject: \"@{{username}} is now following you!\",\n  html: \"Just writing to let you know that <code>@{{username}}</code> ({{name}}) is now following you.\",\n  attachments: [\n    {\n     filename: \"{{username}}.jpg\",\n     path: \"{{imagePath}}\" \n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo deliver email using templates, when adding documents to your `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, include a `template` field with `name` and `data` properties. For example, using our `following` template from above:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    toUids: [\"abc123\"],\n    template: {\n      name: \"following\",\n      data: {\n        username: \"ada\",\n        name: \"Ada Lovelace\",\n        imagePath: \"https://path-to-file/image-name.jpg\"\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n#### Template Partials\n\nTemplates may be registered reusable [partials](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html) by specifying `{partial: true}` in the document in the template collection. Each of the standard data fields (`subject`, `html`, `text`, and `amp`) will be defined as a partial used only in its own environment. For example, a partial called `footer` might have data like:\n\n```js\n{\n  partial: true,\n  html: \"<p>This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. <a href='https://example.com/unsubscribe'>Unsubscribe</a></p>\",\n  text: \"This mail was sent by ExampleApp, Inc. Unsubscribe here: https://example.com/unsubscribe\"\n}\n```\n\nIn another template, the partial can be included by its name (document ID):\n\n```html\n<p>This is my main template content, but it will use a common footer.</p>\n\n{{> footer }}\n```\n\n#### Security rules and sending email\n\nThis extension can be used to trigger email delivery directly from client applications. However, you should carefully control client access to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection to avoid potential abuse (you don't want users able to send arbitrary emails from your company's address!).\n\nSecurity rules will vary from application to application, but you should always make sure that emails are sent only to intended recipients and free-form content is kept to a minimum. Templates can help here -- you can use security rules to verify that the data being populated to the template matches your expectations for what a user should be allowed to trigger.\n\n#### Email delivery processing\n\nWhen a document is added to the `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}` collection, the extension picks it up for email delivery processing. The extension creates and updates a `delivery` field in the document as it processes the email. The `delivery` field can be populated with the following fields:\n\n- **state:** One of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCESS`, or `ERROR`.\n- **startTime:** Timestamp when email processing began.\n- **endTime:** Timestamp when email processing completed (that is, ended in either a `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state).\n- **error:** If there was an email delivery error, an error message will be populated here.\n- **attempts:** Number of delivery attempts for this email.\n- **leaseExpireTime:** In case of a hang or timeout, the time at which a `PROCESSING` state should be considered an error.\n- **info:** After successful email delivery (to at least one address), this field will be populated with the following fields:\n  - **messageId:** The message ID of the delivered email.\n  - **accepted:** Array of email addresses to which the email was successfully delivered.\n  - **rejected:** Array of email addresses to which the email could not be delivered.\n  - **pending:** Array of email addresses that were temporarily rejected by SMTP.\n  - **response:** The last response from the SMTP server.\n\nAn email will typically go from `PENDING` to `PROCESSING` to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. Once in the `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` state, additional changes to the document will not trigger the extension to send another email. To resend an email with document updates, you can change the `state` to `PENDING` or `RETRY`.\n\n#### Manual retries\n\nThere are instances in which email delivery fails in a recoverable fashion or the document can be manually corrected for proper delivery with minor modifications. While retries are not automatic, you can manually change the `state` in the `delivery` field to `RETRY` so that the extension attempts email delivery again (and increments the number of `attempts`).\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Additional setup\n\nBefore installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s free tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#expandable-24))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension? You usually want a location close to your database. For help selecting a location, refer to the [location selection guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document).  You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, if the template is specified in the added email document.\n\n\n\n**Cloud Functions:**\n\n* **processQueue:** Processes document changes in the specified Cloud Firestore collection, delivers emails, and updates the document with delivery status information.\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email","systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime.

You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service’s no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields.

You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1.

Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates.

In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.

The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","postinstallContent":"### See it in action\n\nYou can test out this extension right away!\n\n1.  Go to your [Cloud Firestore dashboard](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/${param:PROJECT_ID}/firestore/data) in the Firebase console. Note that, if you have configured a non-default firestore database, you may have to view it via the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/${param:DATABASE}).\n\n1.  If it doesn't already exist, create the collection you specified during installation: `${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}`.\n\n1.  Add a document with a `to` field and a `message` field with the following content:\n\n    ```js\n    to: ['someone@example.com'],\n    message: {\n      subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n      text: 'This is the plaintext section of the email body.',\n      html: 'This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.',\n    }\n    ```\n\n1.  In a few seconds, you'll see a `delivery` field appear in the document. The field will update as the extension processes the email.\n\n**Note:** You can also use the [Firebase Admin SDK][admin_sdk] to add a document:\n\n```js\nadmin\n  .firestore()\n  .collection(\"${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\")\n  .add({\n    to: \"someone@example.com\",\n    message: {\n      subject: \"Hello from Firebase!\",\n      text: \"This is the plaintext section of the email body.\",\n      html: \"This is the <code>HTML</code> section of the email body.\",\n    },\n  })\n  .then(() => console.log(\"Queued email for delivery!\"));\n```\n\n### Using this extension\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email) for information on using this extension, including advanced use cases such as using Handlebars templates and managing email delivery status.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n##### Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Understanding SendGrid Email IDs\n\nWhen an email is sent successfully, the extension tracks two different IDs in the delivery information:\n\n- **Queue ID**: This is SendGrid's internal queue identifier (from the `x-message-id` header). It's useful for tracking the email within SendGrid's system.\n- **Message ID**: This is the RFC-2822 Message-ID header, which is a standard email identifier used across email systems.\n\nYou can find both IDs in the `delivery.info` field of your email document after successful delivery:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"delivery\": {\n    \"info\": {\n      \"messageId\": \"<unique-message-id@your-domain.com>\",\n      \"sendgridQueueId\": \"sendgrid-queue-id\",\n      \"accepted\": [\"recipient@example.com\"],\n      \"rejected\": [],\n      \"pending\": [],\n      \"response\": \"status=202\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n\n### Monitoring\n\nAs a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.\n\n[mail_collection]: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore/data~2F${param:MAIL_COLLECTION}\n[admin_sdk]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup\n[amp4email]: https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/email-spec/amp-email-format/\n[handlebars]: https://handlebarsjs.com/\n\n### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)","readmeContent":"# Trigger Email from Firestore\n\n**Author**: Firebase (**[https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)**)\n\n**Description**: Composes and sends an email based on the contents of a document written to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\n\n\n**Details**: Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nAdding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)\n\nHere's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:\n\n```js\nadmin.firestore().collection('mail').add({\n  to: 'someone@example.com',\n  message: {\n    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',\n    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.\n\nWhen you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.\n\n#### Using custom headers\n\nYou can add custom headers to your emails by including a `headers` field in the document you add to the Firestore collection. The `headers` field should be an object where each key is the header name and the value is the header value.\n\n## Example JSON with Custom Headers:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Custom Headers\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if custom headers work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if custom headers work.</strong>\"\n  },\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"X-Custom-Header\": \"CustomValue\",\n    \"X-Another-Header\": \"AnotherValue\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email with custom headers.\nYou can even include headers like 'List-Unsubscribe' to allow recipients to unsubscribe from your emails.\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Categories\n\nWhen using SendGrid (`SMTP_CONNECTION_URI` includes `sendgrid.net`), you can assign categories to your emails.\n\n## Example JSON with Categories:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"categories\": [\"Example_Category\"],\n  \"message\": {\n    \"subject\": \"Test Email with Categories\",\n    \"text\": \"This is a test email to see if categories work.\",\n    \"html\": \"<strong>This is a test email to see if categories work.</strong>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send categorized emails.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Categories documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/categories).\n\n#### Firestore-Send-Email: SendGrid Dynamic Templates\n\nWhen using SendGrid, you can use SendGrid Dynamic Templates to create and send templated emails.\n\n## Example JSON representation of Firestore document for a Dynamic Template:\n```json\n{\n  \"to\": [\"example@example.com\"],\n  \"sendGrid\": {\n    \"templateId\": \"d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",  // SendGrid Dynamic Template ID always starts with 'd-'\n    \"dynamicTemplateData\": {\n      \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n      \"company\": \"Example Corp\",\n      \"position\": \"Developer\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdd this document to the Firestore mail collection to send an email using a SendGrid Dynamic Template. The `templateId` is required and should be your SendGrid Dynamic Template ID (always starts with 'd-'). The `dynamicTemplateData` object contains the variables that will be used in your template.\n\nFor more details, see the [SendGrid Dynamic Templates documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/how-to-send-an-email-with-dynamic-templates).\n\n#### Setting Up OAuth2 Authentication\n\nThis section will help you set up OAuth2 authentication for the extension, using GCP (Gmail) as an example.\n\nThe extension is agnostic with respect to OAuth2 provider. You just need to provide it with valid Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token parameters.\n\n##### Step 1: Create OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Platform\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n2. Select your project\n3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**\n4. Click Create Credentials and select **OAuth client ID**\n5. Set the application type to **Web application**\n6. Give your OAuth client a name (e.g., \"Firestore Send Email Extension\")\n7. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the URI where you'll receive the OAuth callback, for example, `http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback`.\n\n   **Note**: The redirect URI in your OAuth client settings MUST match exactly the callback URL in your code.\n\n8. Click **Create**.\n\n##### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen\n\n1. In Google Cloud Console, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**\n2. Choose the appropriate user type:\n   - **External**: For applications used by any Google user\n   - **Internal**: For applications used only by users in your organization\n\n> **Important Note**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens will expire after 7 days unless the User Type is set to \"Internal.\"\n\n##### Step 3: Generate a Refresh Token\n\nYou can use a standalone helper script (`oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js`) that generates a refresh token without requiring any npm installations. \n\n**Prerequisites:**\n- You must have Node.js installed on your machine\n\n**Download the script:**\n1. Download the script using curl, wget, or directly from your browser:\n   ```bash\n   # Using curl\n   curl -o oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   \n   # Using wget\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firebase/extensions/refs/heads/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n   You can also [view the script on GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/extensions/blob/master/firestore-send-email/scripts/oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js) and download it manually.\n\n> **Note**: If you are creating your own application to obtain a refresh token, in a Node.js environment where you can use npm packages, consider using the official google-auth-library instead:\n> \n> 1. Install the library: `npm install google-auth-library`\n> 2. Then use it like this:\n>    ```javascript\n>    import { OAuth2Client } from \"google-auth-library\";\n>    \n>    // Initialize OAuth client\n>    const oAuth2Client = new OAuth2Client(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI);\n>    \n>    // Generate authorization URL\n>    const authorizeUrl = oAuth2Client.generateAuthUrl({\n>      access_type: \"offline\",\n>      prompt: \"consent\",\n>      scope: [\"https://mail.google.com/\"],  // Full Gmail access\n>    });\n>    \n>    // After receiving the code from the callback:\n>    const { tokens } = await oAuth2Client.getToken(code);\n>    const refreshToken = tokens.refresh_token;\n>    ```\n\n2. Run the script with Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n   ```\n\n3. The script supports the following command-line options:\n   ```\n   --port, -p     Port to run the server on (default: 8080 or PORT env var)\n   --id, -i       Google OAuth Client ID\n   --secret, -s   Google OAuth Client Secret\n   --output, -o   Output file to save the refresh token (default: refresh_token.txt)\n   --help, -h     Show help information\n   ```\n\n4. You can either provide your credentials as command-line arguments or set them as environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   # Using environment variables\n   export CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\n   export CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js\n\n   # Using command-line arguments\n   node oauth2-refresh-token-helper.js --id=your_client_id --secret=your_client_secret\n   ```\n\n5. The script will:\n   - Start a local web server\n   - Open your browser to the OAuth consent page\n   - Receive the authorization code\n   - Exchange the code for tokens\n   - Save the refresh token to a file (default: `refresh_token.txt`)\n   - Display the refresh token in your browser\n\n6. **Important**: The redirect URI in the script (`http://localhost:8080/oauth/callback` by default) **MUST** match exactly what you configured in the Google Cloud Console OAuth client settings.\n\n7. The script automatically requests the appropriate scope for Gmail access (`https://mail.google.com/`) and sets the authorization parameters to always receive a refresh token (`access_type: \"offline\"` and `prompt: \"consent\"`).\n\n##### Step 4: Configure the Firestore Send Email Extension\n\nWhen installing the extension, select \"OAuth2\" as the **Authentication Type** and provide the following parameters:\n\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com` (for Gmail)\n- **OAuth2 SMTP Port**: `465` (for SMTPS) or `587` (for STARTTLS)\n- **Use Secure OAuth2 Connection**: `true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)\n- **OAuth2 Client ID**: Your Client ID from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Client Secret**: Your Client Secret from GCP\n- **OAuth2 Refresh Token**: The refresh token generated in Step 3\n- **SMTP User**: Your full Gmail email address\n\nLeave `Use secure OAuth2 connection?` as the default value `true`.\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\n###### Refresh Token Expiration\n\n- **Testing Status**: If your OAuth consent screen is in \"Testing\" status, refresh tokens expire after 7 days unless User Type is set to \"Internal\"\n- **Solution**: Either publish your app or ensure User Type is set to \"Internal\" in the OAuth consent screen settings\n\n###### No Refresh Token Received\n\n- **Problem**: If you don't receive a refresh token during the OAuth flow\n- **Solution**: Make sure you've revoked previous access or forced consent by going to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > Third-party apps with account access\n\n###### Scope Issues\n\n- **Problem**: If you see authentication errors, you might not have the correct scopes\n- **Solution**: Ensure you've added `https://mail.google.com/` as a scope in the OAuth consent screen\n\n###### Additional Resources\n\n- [Google OAuth2 Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)\n- [Nodemailer OAuth2 Guide](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/oauth2/)\n- [Firebase Extensions Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions)\n\n#### Automatic Deletion of Email Documents\n\nTo use Firestore's TTL feature for automatic deletion of expired email documents, the extension provides several configuration parameters.\n\nThe extension will set a TTL field in the email documents, but you will need to manually configure a TTL policy for the collection/collection group the extension targets, on the `delivery.expireAt` field.\n\nDetailed instructions for creating a TTL field can be found in the [Firestore TTL Policy documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl).\n\n#### Billing\nTo install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)\n\n- This extension uses other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform services, which have associated charges if you exceed the service's no-cost tier:\n  - Cloud Firestore\n  - Cloud Functions (Node.js 10+ runtime. [See FAQs](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#extensions-pricing))\n\nUsage of this extension also requires you to have SMTP credentials for mail delivery. You are responsible for any associated costs with your usage of your SMTP provider.\n\n#### Further reading & resources\n\nYou can find more information about this extension in the following articles:\n\n- [Sending Emails Using Firestore And Firebase Extensions](https://invertase.link/Y6Nu)\n\n\n\n**Configuration Parameters:**\n\n* Firestore Instance ID: The Firestore database to use. Use \"(default)\" for the default database. You can view your available Firestore databases at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Firestore Instance Location: Where is the Firestore database located? You can check your current database location at [https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases).\n\n\n* Authentication Type: The authentication type to be used for the SMTP server (e.g., OAuth2, Username & Password.\n\n* SMTP connection URI: A URI representing an SMTP server this extension can use to deliver email. Note that port 25 is blocked by Google Cloud Platform, so we recommend using port 587 for SMTP connections. If you're using the SMTPS protocol, we recommend using port 465. In order to keep passwords secure, it is recommended to omit the password from the connection string while using the `SMTP Password` field for entering secrets and passwords. Passwords and secrets should now be included in `SMTP password` field.\nSecure format:\n `smtps://username@gmail.com@smtp.gmail.com:465` (username only)\n `smtps://smtp.gmail.com:465` (No username and password)\nBackwards Compatible (less secure):\n `smtps://username@gmail.com:password@smtp.gmail.com:465`. (username and\npassword)\n\n* SMTP password: User password for the SMTP server\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Host: The OAuth2 hostname of the SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP Port: The OAuth2 port number for the SMTP server (e.g., 465 for SMTPS, 587 for STARTTLS).\n\n* Use secure OAuth2 connection?: Set to true to enable a secure connection (TLS/SSL) when using OAuth2 authentication for the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client ID: The OAuth2 Client ID for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Client Secret: The OAuth2 Client Secret for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 Refresh Token: The OAuth2 Refresh Token for authentication with the SMTP server.\n\n* OAuth2 SMTP User: The OAuth2 user email or username for SMTP authentication.\n\n* Email documents collection: What is the path to the collection that contains the documents used to build and send the emails?\n\n* Default FROM address: The email address to use as the sender's address (if it's not specified in the added email document). You can optionally include a name with the email address (`Friendly Firebaser <foobar@example.com>`). This parameter does not work with [Gmail SMTP](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).\n\n* Default REPLY-TO address: The email address to use as the reply-to address (if it's not specified in the added email document).\n\n* Users collection: A collection of documents keyed by user UID. If the `toUids`, `ccUids`, and/or `bccUids` recipient options are used in the added email document, this extension delivers email to the `email` field based on lookups in this collection.\n\n* Templates collection: A collection of email templates keyed by name. This extension can render an email using a [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template, it's recommended to use triple curly braces `{{{  }}}` in your Handlebars templates when the substitution value is a URL or otherwise sensitive to HTML escaping.\n\n* Firestore TTL type: Do you want the firestore records to be marked with an expireAt field for a TTL policy? If \"Never\" is selected then no expireAt field will be added. Otherwise you may specify the unit of time specified by the TTL_EXPIRE_VALUE parameter. Defaults to \"Never\".\n\n* Firestore TTL value: In the units specified by TTL_EXPIRE_TYPE, how long do you want records to be ineligible for deletion by a TTL policy? This parameter requires the Firestore TTL type parameter to be set to a value other than `Never`. For example, if `Firestore TTL type` is set to `Day` then setting this parameter to `1` will specify a TTL of 1 day.\n\n* TLS Options: A JSON value representing TLS options. For more information, see https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_class_tls_tlssocket\n\n\n\n**Other Resources**:\n\n* processQueue (firebaseextensions.v1beta.v2function)\n\n\n\n**Access Required**:\n\n\n\nThis extension will operate with the following project IAM roles:\n\n* datastore.user (Reason: Allows this extension to access Cloud Firestore to read and process added email documents.)\n","displayName":"Trigger Email from Firestore","events":[{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onStart","description":"Occurs when the extension starts execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onProcessing","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to process an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onRetry","description":"Occurs when the extension attempts to resend an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onPending","description":"Occurs when an email has a pending status."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onSuccess","description":"Occurs when the extension successfully sends an email."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onComplete","description":"Occurs when the extension completes execution."},{"type":"firebase.extensions.firestore-send-email.v1.onError","description":"Occurs when the extension fails to complete execution."}],"systemParams":[{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/timeoutSeconds","label":"Function timeout seconds","type":"STRING","description":"How long should functions run before timing out, in seconds (0-540)?","validationRegex":"^[1-9][0-9]{0,2}$","validationErrorMessage":"Function timeout should be an integer number of seconds, between 0 and 540","advanced":true},{"param":"firebaseextensions.v1beta.function/vpcConnector","label":"VPC Connector","type":"STRING","description":"The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to.
